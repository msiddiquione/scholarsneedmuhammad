"2. Prioritized Data Cleaning Recommendations
Execute these steps in order to prepare your dataset for analysis.

Priority 1: Convert Percentage Strings to Numbers
• Issue: Columns like % Female, % Asian, % Poverty, etc., are text strings (e.g., ""48.9%"") rather than numbers.
• Action:
  1. Strip the ""%"" symbol from the right side of the string.
  2. Convert the remaining text to a float.
  3. (Optional) Divide by 100 if you prefer decimals (0.489) over integers (48.9).

Priority 2: Fix ""Object"" Columns that Should Be Numeric
  • Issue: The columns # White, Cleaned Economic Need Index, # Poverty, and Economic Need Index are read as text because they contain non-numeric values.
• Action:
  • For # Poverty & # White: Scan for values like ""Above 95%"" or ""Below 5%"". These mask the true count. Strategy: You may need to replace these with an estimated value (e.g., total enrollment * 0.95) or set them to NaN (null) if exact precision is required.
  • For Economic Need Index: Ensure all values are numeric. Remove any rows or cells that contain explanatory text instead of a score.

Priority 3: Handle Missing Values (NULLs)
• Issue: Charter (Y/N) ? has only ~1,305 non-null entries out of ~9,332 rows. Unnamed: 47 & 48 are entirely empty.
• Action:
  • Drop Unnamed: 47 and Unnamed: 48.
  • Impute Charter (Y/N) ?: Inspect the empty values. If these represent public schools (non-charters), fill the NULLs with ""No"". If the data is truly missing, flag it as ""Unknown"".
  • Impute Charter School Network?: Similar to above, fill NULLs with ""Non-Charter"" or ""N/A"" if appropriate.

Priority 4: Standardize ""Year"" Column
• Issue: Year is currently a string like ""2018-19"".
• Action: Create a new column Year_Start (Integer) by taking the first 4 characters (e.g., 2018). This allows for proper chronological sorting and plotting.

Priority 5: Validate Categorical Consistency
• Issue: Borough column may have inconsistent naming (e.g., ""M"" vs ""Manhattan"").
• Action: Check distinct values in Borough. Map abbreviations to full names if necessary (e.g., M -> Manhattan, K -> Brooklyn) to ensure charts are readable.",,,

"QA Validation Report: Enrollment (Cleaned) Tab

Here is the detailed Quality Assurance (QA) report for the 'Enrollment (cleaned)' tab.
1. Data Distortion Check (Qualifiers)

• Status: Confirmed Removal (with exceptions).
• Findings:
  • Count of Qualifiers: There are 0 rows in the # Poverty, # White, or Economic Need Index columns that currently contain the text ""Above"" or ""Below"". These qualifiers appear to have been successfully removed or replaced.
  • Numeric Type Validation:
    • # Poverty: Pass. This column is strictly numeric (Integer).
    • # White: Fail. This column is currently stored as Text (Object) because it contains at least one non-numeric placeholder value (e.g., \). This prevents it from being used in calculations.
    • Economic Need Index: Fail. This column is currently stored as Text (Object) because the values still contain percentage symbols (e.g., 77.2%), even though the ""Above/Below"" text is gone.
• Recommendation: You must remove the \ from # White and the % from Economic Need Index to make them fully numeric.


2. Percentage Scaling Check (Decimal Conversion)

• Status: Action Required & Simulated.
• Current State: The percentage columns (e.g., % Female, % Asian) were found to be stored as whole numbers (e.g., 48.9 for 48.9%), not decimals.
• Action Taken: I have verified that applying the division formula converts these correctly.
• Scaled Result: After dividing by 100, the data is correctly scaled to decimal format (e.g., 0.489).
  • Example: % Female max value converted from 100.0 to 1.0.


3. Structural Integrity Check (Remaining Errors)

• Year Column: Pass.
  • All 9,332 rows contain valid 4-digit integers (Range: 2018–2022). No text or errors were found.
• New Numeric Percentage Columns: Pass.
  • There are 0 non-numeric entries (such as #VALUE! or residuals) in the percentage columns.
• Remaining Error in # White:
  • As noted above, the # White column contains 1 non-numeric entry: \ (backslash). This single cell is causing the entire column to be treated as text.


4. Categorical Validation

• Borough Column: Pass.
  • The column contains only the standardized full names. No abbreviations (M, K, etc.) or typos were found.
  • Unique Values: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island.",,,
