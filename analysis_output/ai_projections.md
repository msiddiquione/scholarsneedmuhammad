# Success Academy Enrollment Projections

Okay, here's an analysis and projection of Success Academy enrollment based on the provided data, formatted for a senior stakeholder:

## Success Academy Enrollment Projection (2023-2027)

Here is a projection of Success Academy's total enrollment for the next five years:

**1) 5-YEAR ENROLLMENT PROJECTION (2023-2027)**

| Year | Projected Total Enrollment |
|------|----------------------------|
| 2023 | 16,275                     |
| 2024 | 16,234                     |
| 2025 | 16,193                     |
| 2026 | 16,152                     |
| 2027 | 16,111                     |

**2) PROJECTION METHODOLOGY:**

The projection is based on a linear regression model applied to the historical total enrollment data from 2018 to 2022. The regression model identifies the average yearly change in total enrollment and extends this trend into the future.

**3) KEY ASSUMPTIONS:**

*   **Consistent Trend:** The primary assumption is that the recent trend of declining enrollment will continue at a similar rate over the next five years.
*   **No Major Disruptions:**  The model assumes no significant external factors will dramatically alter enrollment patterns (e.g., major policy changes, economic downturn impacting families, new competitor schools opening).
*   **School Capacity:** The model assumes that school capacity will remain relatively stable.

**4) ADDITIONAL DATA SOURCES RECOMMENDED:**

To enhance the accuracy and robustness of these projections, I recommend incorporating the following data sources:

*   **Application and Waitlist Data:**  Detailed data on the number of applications received, waitlist sizes by grade level and school, and acceptance rates would provide valuable insight into future demand.
*   **Student Attrition Rates:** Analyzing student attrition rates (reasons for leaving, grade levels most affected, etc.) will help refine projections by accounting for student departures.
*   **Demographic Data:** Analyzing demographic trends in the communities served by Success Academy (birth rates, migration patterns, income levels) can provide leading indicators of future enrollment potential.
*   **Competitor Analysis:** Information on the performance, expansion plans, and marketing efforts of other charter and public schools in the area would help assess competitive pressures on Success Academy enrollment.
*   **Geographic Data:** Understanding where newly enrolled students are coming from may indicate whether there should be more schools in a certain area.

These additional data sources, combined with more sophisticated modeling techniques, would significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of future enrollment projections.
