## Success Academy: NYC School Enrollment Analysis - Executive Summary

This report summarizes NYC school enrollment trends over the past five years (2018-2022), focusing on Success Academy (SA) performance and future projections. While District Schools (DS) maintain the majority of enrollment share, charter schools (C) and SA show unique trends.

**1. MARKET OBSERVATIONS:**

*   **Declining District School Enrollment:** District School enrollment has been steadily declining over the 5-year period.
*   **Success Academy Plateau:** SA enrollment peaked in 2020 and has plateaued and slightly declined in the most recent years.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Increase in public charter schools competing for students.
*   **Average Enrollment per School:** Success Academy consistently outpaces District and Charter schools in average enrollment per school.

**2. RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL DATA:**

To enhance our understanding and inform strategic decision-making, we recommend gathering the following data:

*   **Student Demographics:** (Race, Ethnicity, Income) to understand SA's reach within different communities.
*   **Student Performance Data:** (Standardized Test Scores, Graduation Rates) to compare SA performance to other school types.
*   **Student Attrition Rates:** to understand reasons for student departures.
*   **Geographic Distribution of Schools:** Mapping enrollment trends alongside school locations to identify growth areas and potential saturation.

**3. 5-YEAR PROJECTION SUMMARY:**

Based on a 3-year average growth rate calculation (-5.2%), our model projects a continued decline in SA enrollment over the next five years.

*   **Assumptions:** This projection assumes a continuation of recent enrollment trends, stable market conditions, and no significant changes in SA's operating environment or competitive landscape. The 3 year average accounts for recent trends more than earlier years.
*   **Risks:** This projection is sensitive to factors such as new school openings, changes in government funding, shifts in parental preferences, and potential economic downturns affecting families' ability to participate. It is also reliant on past data, and enrollment trends may shift.

**4. DASHBOARD RECOMMENDATIONS:**

*   **Target Users:** Success Academy leadership, school administrators, and recruitment teams.
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   Total Enrollment (SA, DS, C)
    *   Enrollment Growth Rate (SA vs. Market)
